==============================

A set of starting point principles for independent, public-interest archive projects.

**[Principles for Independent Archives](https://github.com/equivalentideas/independent-archive-principles/blob/master/independent-archive-principles.md)**

This repository contains some broad, basic goals for an independent archive project and design principles which could help the project achieve them.

See the introductory article at Equivalent Ideas: [Approaching Principles for Independent Archives](equivalentideas.com/journal/approaching-principles-for-independent-archives/ 'What should an independent archive do? Some starter ideas and an invitation for contributions, posted 17th February 2014')

This is meant to be the start of a conversation. Any kind of rough contribution or idea is very, very welcome.

Contributions could include:

*    Leaving a [comment on the original article](http://equivalentideas.com/journal/approaching-principles-for-independent-archives/#disqus_thread), of any length with a response or thought about what an independent archive should do;
*    making pull-requests/issues to add or cut principles;
*    suggesting references for more information on individual principles;
*    improving the explanations of principles; and/or
*    pointing out how wording could be improved/typos etc. .
